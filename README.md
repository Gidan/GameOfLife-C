Simple implementation of the Game of Life in C.
This project is just for fun and to practice with the C language.
C is not my main language. Any help on improving the code is welcome.
Feel free to open a PR to improve any aspect of the game code.

## Requirements
- **RayLib 5.5.0** (copy libraries for your system into the lib directory)

## Build
```
make [clean|run]
```

## Usage
As soon as the program starts, the game will not run yet.
Click on the grid to make cells be alive.

When ready, hit ENTER on your keyboard to start the game.

Hit ENTER again to reset and play again.
